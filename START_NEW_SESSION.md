# ðŸš€ Starting a New Session - Quick Prompt

**Copy and paste this into your new chat:**

---

I'm continuing work on the Excel Trading Workflow project. Before we start, please read these project context files in order:

1. **SESSION_2_SUMMARY.md** - Quick recap of recent work
2. **DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md** - Technical context and known issues
3. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history
4. **.clinerules** - Project rules and patterns

After reading, please:
- Confirm current version and status
- Summarize any known issues
- Let me know you're ready to help!

---

## Alternative: Short Version

```
Check .clinerules and read SESSION_2_SUMMARY.md, DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md, and CHANGELOG.md for project context before we start.
```

## What This Does

The AI assistant will:
1. âœ… Read all critical context files
2. âœ… Understand the project state (v2.0.0)
3. âœ… Know about recent bug fixes
4. âœ… Remember critical rules (no Unicode in VBA, etc.)
5. âœ… Be aware of known issues and patterns
6. âœ… Use the correct communication style for you

This ensures continuity across sessions and prevents repeating past mistakes.

## Files the AI Will Read
