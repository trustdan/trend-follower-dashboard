# Final Fixes - Complete Workbook Setup

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Issues**: Empty sheets + Sheet11 still appearing

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Call Correct Setup Macro

**Before**: Called `Setup.RunOnce` (only creates basic sheets with headers)
**After**: Calls `TF_Data.EnsureStructure` (creates everything)

`TF_Data.EnsureStructure` creates:
- ✅ 8 Sheets (TradeEntry, Presets, Buckets, Candidates, Decisions, Positions, Summary, Control)
- ✅ 5 Tables (tblPresets, tblBuckets, tblCandidates, tblDecisions, tblPositions)
- ✅ 7 Named Ranges (Equity_E, RiskPct_r, StopMultiple_K, HeatCap_H_pct, BucketHeatCap_pct, AddStepN, EarningsBufferDays)
- ✅ Default Data (5 FINVIZ presets, 6 sector buckets)

**File Modified**: `import_to_excel.py` (line 71-86)

---

### 2. Improved Sheet Code Application

**Problem**: Sheet_TradeEntry.cls was being imported as a standalone class (appeared as Sheet11)

**Root Cause**:
- Script looked for sheet by CodeName "TradeEntry"
- If not found, it imported as a class module
- Sheet exists but might have different CodeName (e.g., "Sheet2")

**Fix**: Enhanced sheet search logic:
1. Try direct CodeName lookup first
2. If not found, search all worksheet components by Name
3. Match worksheet Name to target sheet name
4. Apply code to the correct worksheet component
5. If still not found, SKIP instead of importing as class

**Result**:
- No more Sheet11
- TradeEntry sheet gets proper event handlers
- Clear diagnostic messages

**File Modified**: `import_to_excel.py` (lines 110-152)

del TrendFollowing_TradeEntry.xlsm
BUILD_WITH_PYTHON.bat
```

## Verification Checklist

After building:

1. **Open workbook**: Should see 8 sheets
2. **Check Presets sheet**: Should have 5 rows of FINVIZ queries
3. **Check Buckets sheet**: Should have 6 rows (Tech/Comm, Consumer, etc.)
4. **Check Summary sheet**: Should have labels and values (Equity_E = 10000)
5. **Press Alt+F11**: VBA Editor
   - Should see 7 standard modules
   - Should see TradeEntry under "Microsoft Excel Objects" (NOT Sheet11)
   - TradeEntry should have code (Worksheet_Activate, Worksheet_Change)
6. **Compile check**: Debug → Compile VBAProject (should be no errors)
