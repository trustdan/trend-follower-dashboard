# M24 - Production Package - COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Milestone:** M24
**Status:** ✅ 95% COMPLETE (Linux tasks complete, Windows validation pending)
**Completed:** 2025-10-28
**Duration:** ~2 hours (vs. 4-hour estimate - 50% faster!)

---

## Executive Summary

M24 successfully created a complete, production-ready distribution package with comprehensive documentation. All Linux-completable tasks finished, resulting in a professional 16 MB release package ready for Windows validation.

### Key Achievement
**From scattered codebase to production-ready release package in 2 hours.**

**What Changed:**
