# Step 26: Windows Installer - Ready to Start

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Current Status:** üü° 95% Ready - Minor Blockers Identified

---

## Executive Summary

Your Windows testing was **incredibly valuable**! The TF-Engine binary runs perfectly on Windows with the pure-Go SQLite driver. We're 95% ready to build the installer - just need to fix one small blocker first.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working (Excellent News!)

1. **Binary runs on Windows** ‚úÖ No CGo needed!
2. **Pure-Go SQLite driver** ‚úÖ Works perfectly
3. **Embedded UI loads** ‚úÖ All 42 assets load correctly
4. **FINVIZ scraper** ‚úÖ Found 93 tickers in 12.6 seconds
5. **Server infrastructure** ‚úÖ HTTP, logging, graceful shutdown all work
6. **Cross-platform build** ‚úÖ Linux ‚Üí Windows compilation successful

## ‚ùå Blocker (15-30 min fix)

**Database initialization not implemented:**
- The `init` command exists in the CLI menu but returns "TODO"
- The database file is created but empty (no tables)
- This causes all API endpoints to fail with "no such table" errors

**Impact:**
- Users can't use the app on first run
- Installer needs to run `init` during installation

**Solution:**
- Wire up the `init` command (the `db.Initialize()` method already exists)
- Add AppData path support (Windows best practice)
- Rebuild binary and test

**Time:** 15-30 minutes

## üìã Step 26 Roadmap

### Phase 0: Fix Blockers (1-2 hours) ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED FIRST
1. Implement `init` command
2. Add Windows AppData path support
3. Test on Windows

### Phase 1: Application Icon (1-2 hours)
1. Create or download icon
2. Convert to .ico format
3. Embed in binary with go-winres

### Phase 2: NSIS Installer (3-4 hours)
1. Write installer script
2. Add database initialization step
3. Create shortcuts with correct paths
4. Build installer

### Phase 3: Testing (2-3 hours)
1. Test installation on clean Windows
2. Test all functionality
3. Test uninstallation
4. Test reinstallation

### Phase 4: Documentation (1 hour)
1. Write installation guide
2. Document troubleshooting steps
3. Create build instructions

**Total Time:** 8-12 hours (1-2 days)

## üéØ Next Steps (You Choose)

### Option A: Fix Blocker Immediately
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Outcome:** Binary fully ready for installer

```bash
# I can implement:
1. InitCommand() function
2. getDefaultDBPath() for Windows AppData
3. Update ServerCommand() to use same path
4. Rebuild and test on Windows
```

### Option B: Start Installer Work, Fix Blocker Later
**Time:** Skip blocker, start on icon/installer
**Risk:** Will need to rebuild installer after fixing blocker

### Option C: Document and Pause
**Status:** All documented, ready to resume anytime
**Best if:** You want to review plans before proceeding

## üîß Key Decisions Made

### 1. Installer Technology: NSIS
**Why:**
- Can build on Linux (your current environment)
- Simpler than WiX
- Still professional
- Creates .exe installer

**Alternative:** WiX for v2.0 if enterprise demand

### 2. Database Location: %APPDATA%\TF-Engine\
**Why:**
- Windows best practice
- No admin rights needed for writes
- User data separate from program files
- Preserved on uninstall

**Path:** `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\TF-Engine\trading.db`

### 3. Installation Behavior
**Install:**
- Copy .exe to Program Files (requires admin)
- Initialize database in AppData (runs as user)
- Create desktop + Start Menu shortcuts
- Register uninstaller

**Uninstall:**
- Remove program files
- Remove shortcuts
- Remove registry keys
- **Ask** before deleting database (preserve user data by default)

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Fix the blocker first** (1-2 hours)
   - Small effort, big impact
   - Required for installer anyway
   - Validates Windows functionality end-to-end

2. **Test the fix thoroughly** (30 min)
   - Verify database created
   - Verify tables exist
   - Verify all API endpoints work
   - Verify AppData location works

3. **Then proceed with installer** (6-10 hours)
   - Create icon (1-2h)
   - Build installer (3-4h)
   - Test thoroughly (2-3h)
   - Document (1h)

## üéâ What You Validated Today

Your testing session proved:
- ‚úÖ Windows deployment is viable
- ‚úÖ No CGo dependencies needed
- ‚úÖ Pure-Go SQLite works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Embedded UI works cross-platform
- ‚úÖ FINVIZ scraping works from Windows
- ‚úÖ Binary is production-ready (after init fix)

**This is huge!** Many Go apps struggle with SQLite on Windows due to CGo. You've eliminated that entire category of problems.

## üìû What Do You Want to Do?

**Reply with:**
- **"Fix blocker"** ‚Üí I'll implement the init command now
- **"Start installer"** ‚Üí We'll begin with the icon and NSIS script (knowing blocker exists)
- **"Just document"** ‚Üí We're done, all plans are documented
- **"Show me code"** ‚Üí I'll show you exactly what needs to be implemented

---

**Bottom Line:** Your Windows testing was extremely successful. We found exactly ONE blocker (database init), which is a 15-30 minute fix. The path to Step 26 completion is crystal clear.

**Your call!** üöÄ
