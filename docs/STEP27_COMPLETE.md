## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Release)
1. **Capture screenshots** (40+ images)
   - Use docs/screenshots/README.md as reference
   - Capture all states (RED/YELLOW/GREEN banners, gates, etc.)
   - Optimize images (< 500 KB each)
   - Verify all paths match documentation

2. **Review documentation** (1-2 hours)
   - Read through all docs once more
   - Fix any typos or inconsistencies
   - Verify all internal links work
   - Test examples (do calculations match?)

3. **Beta user review** (if available)
   - Give docs to non-technical trader
   - Watch them follow QUICK_START.md
   - Note confusion points
   - Update docs accordingly

### Future Enhancements
1. **Video tutorials** (optional)
   - Quick Start walkthrough (5 min)
   - Daily workflow demo (10 min)
   - TradingView integration (5 min)

2. **In-app tooltips** (from USER_GUIDE content)

## Step 28 Preview

**Next (Final Step):**
- Step 28: Final Validation & Release

- Prepare release notes
- Tag v1.0.0 release

**Estimate:** 1 day

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Structured approach:** Following Step 27 plan closely
2. **User-first thinking:** Always asking "what would confuse a trader?"
3. **Real examples:** Using $100k account, 0.75% risk throughout
4. **Cross-referencing:** Each doc points to related docs
5. **Multi-level depth:** Quick Start → User Guide → FAQ → Troubleshooting

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Screenshots earlier:** Would have been easier to write docs with real screenshots
2. **Beta testing:** Need real user feedback before release
3. **Video tutorials:** Would complement written docs well

### Recommendations for Future Projects
1. **Create documentation in parallel with development** (not after)
2. **Involve non-technical users early** (beta docs review)
3. **Plan screenshot capture workflow upfront** (specific tool, settings, naming)
