- **Phase 5 remaining:** 5 steps (Testing, Bug fixes, Installer, Documentation, Final validation)
- Continue with Phase 4-5 documentation OR begin implementation

## [2025-10-29 13:05] Session Start - Phase 0 Step 1 Execution

- **Goals:** Execute Phase 0 Step 1 - Development Environment Setup per `plans/phase0-step1-dev-environment.md`
- **Environment:** Kali Linux 2025.2 on WSL2, Go 1.24.2, Node 20.19.0
- **Constraints:** No Git in Linux; Windows is the Git home

## [2025-10-29 13:30] Changes - Phase 0 Step 1 COMPLETE ✅

- **Summary:** Completed comprehensive development environment setup and verification
- **Files created/modified:**
  - `.vscode/settings.json` - VSCode Go/Svelte configuration with formatting, linting
  - `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations for tf-engine and tests
  - `docs/dev-environment.md` - **Complete environment documentation** (new)
  - `backend/internal/cli/interactive.go:53` - **Bug fix:** fmt.Println → fmt.Print (redundant newline)

- **Commands run (copy-paste ready):**
  ```bash
  # Environment verification
  cat /etc/os-release
  uname -a | grep -i microsoft
  whoami && echo $HOME
  go version && go env GOPATH && go env GOOS && go env GOARCH
  node --version && npm --version

  # Backend build and tests
  cd /home/kali/fresh-start-trading-platform/backend
  ls -la go.mod
  go mod download
  go test ./... -v
  go test ./... -cover
  go build -o tf-engine cmd/tf-engine/main.go
  ./tf-engine --help

  # Cross-compilation to Windows
  GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" -o tf-engine.exe cmd/tf-engine/main.go
  ls -lh tf-engine.exe
  file tf-engine.exe

  # Logging infrastructure
  cd /home/kali/fresh-start-trading-platform
  mkdir -p logs
  touch logs/test.log && rm logs/test.log
  ```

- **Build artifacts (Linux):**
  - `backend/tf-engine` - Linux binary (18MB ELF)
  - `backend/tf-engine.exe` - Windows binary (11MB PE32+)
  - `.vscode/settings.json` - IDE configuration
  - `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configuration
  - `docs/dev-environment.md` - Complete setup documentation

## Environment Verification Summary

✅ **Go Environment:**
- Version: go1.24.2 linux/amd64
- GOPATH: /root/go
- All tests passing (96.9% coverage on domain logic)
- Linux binary builds (18MB)
- Windows .exe cross-compiles (11MB PE32+)

✅ **Node.js Environment:**
- Version: v20.19.0
- NPM: 9.2.0

✅ **Infrastructure:**
- Logs directory created with write permissions
- Logging package using logrus (already implemented)
- .gitignore configured for log files

✅ **IDE Configuration:**
- VSCode/Cursor settings for Go formatting and linting
- Debug launch configurations for tf-engine and tests

## Test Results (All Passing)

| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| internal/domain | 96.9% | ✅ Excellent |
| internal/storage | 77.1% | ✅ Good |
| internal/logx | 73.3% | ✅ Good |
| internal/scrape | 42.1% | ⚠️ Adequate |
| cmd/tf-engine | 0.0% | ⚠️ Integration tested |
| internal/cli | 0.0% | ⚠️ Integration tested |
| internal/server | 0.0% | ⚠️ Legacy, minimal use |

**Critical business logic:** All tested and passing
- ✅ Position sizing calculations (Van Tharp method)
- ✅ Checklist evaluation (RED/YELLOW/GREEN logic)
- ✅ Heat management (portfolio and bucket caps)
- ✅ 5 gates validation
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ Cooldown management
- ✅ Impulse brake timer

## Bug Fixes

**`backend/internal/cli/interactive.go:53`**
- **Issue:** Build error - `fmt.Println arg list ends with redundant newline`
- **Fix:** Changed `fmt.Println(banner)` to `fmt.Print(banner)`
- **Reason:** Banner string already contains trailing newlines

## Windows Notes (for manual testing)

- **Windows binary created:** `backend/tf-engine.exe` (11MB PE32+ executable)
- **File verification:** `file tf-engine.exe` confirms "PE32+ executable for MS Windows 6.01 (console), x86-64"
- **Testing:** Run `.\tf-engine.exe --help` in PowerShell to verify
- **Expected:** Help text displays without errors
- **Status:** Windows testing not performed in this step (deferred per plan)

## Open Questions / Blockers

None. All verification steps completed successfully.

## Next Steps

- ✅ **Phase 0 Step 1: Development Environment Setup** - COMPLETE
- 📋 **Phase 0 Step 2: Fyne Proof-of-Concept** - READY TO START
  - Review `plans/phase0-step2-fyne-poc.md`
  - Install Fyne and system dependencies
  - Build minimal Fyne app
  - Test cross-platform compilation
  - Document findings

## Notes

- **No Git in Linux** - Workspace is in `/home/kali/fresh-start-trading-platform/`, no git repo initialized
- **Documentation compliance** - Updated LLM-update.md and PROGRESS.md per RULES.md §1 Daily Loop
- **Reproducible build** - All commands documented and tested
- **Windows handoff** - When ready for Windows testing, will create export zip
