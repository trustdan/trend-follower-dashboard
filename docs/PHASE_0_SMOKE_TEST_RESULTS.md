[TF-Engine] 2025/10/29 22:34:01 Opening database: /home/kali/trend-follower-dashboard/backend/trading.db
[TF-Engine] 2025/10/29 22:34:01 Embedded UI loaded successfully
[TF-Engine] 2025/10/29 22:34:01 Server listening on http://127.0.0.1:18888
[TF-Engine] 2025/10/29 22:34:01 Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

### 7. Test UI Homepage
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18888/ | head -30
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - HTML served correctly
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/_app/immutable/entry/start.n5cSvESA.js">
    ...
```

### 8. Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18888/api/settings
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - API responding with valid JSON
```json
{
  "data": {
    "equity": 100000,
    "riskPct": 0.0075,
    "portfolioCap": 4,
    "bucketCap": 1.5,
    "maxUnits": 4
  }
}
```

## Phase 1: 5-Minute Smoke Test (MANUAL BROWSER TESTING)

**Instructions:** Follow these steps to complete the smoke test:

### Prerequisites
1. Server must be running: `./tf-engine server --listen 127.0.0.1:18888`
2. Browser must support modern JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Test Checklist

#### Step 1: Open Browser
- [ ] Open browser to http://localhost:18888
- [ ] Expected: TF-Engine UI loads with Header and Navigation visible

#### Step 2: Open DevTools
- [ ] Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- [ ] Click on "Console" tab
- [ ] Expected: Console should be clean (no red errors)

#### Step 3: Test Navigation Links
Click each navigation item and verify:

- [ ] **Dashboard** (/)
  - Route loads without errors
  - Console shows: "Dashboard page loaded"
  - No `e.subscribe is not a function` error ✅ (FIX VERIFIED)

- [ ] **Scanner** (/scanner)
  - Route loads without errors
  - No console errors

- [ ] **Checklist** (/checklist)
  - Route loads without errors
  - No console errors

- [ ] **Position Sizing** (/sizing)
  - Route loads without errors
  - No console errors

- [ ] **Heat Check** (/heat)
  - Route loads without errors
  - No console errors

- [ ] **Trade Entry** (/entry)
  - Route loads without errors
  - No console errors

- [ ] **Calendar** (/calendar)
  - Route loads without errors
  - No console errors

#### Step 4: Test Theme Toggle
- [ ] Click theme toggle in header (sun/moon icon)
- [ ] Expected: Theme changes smoothly with 0.3s transition
- [ ] Reload page (F5)
- [ ] Expected: Theme preference persists (same theme after reload)
- [ ] Check localStorage in DevTools (Application tab → Local Storage)
- [ ] Expected: See `theme` key with value `light` or `dark`

#### Step 5: Verify Active Route Highlighting
- [ ] Navigate to each route
- [ ] Expected: Navigation item for current route should be highlighted
- [ ] Expected: Active item shows with left border and different background

#### Step 6: Check Console for Errors
- [ ] Review entire console log
- [ ] Expected: ZERO red errors
- [ ] Warnings are OK (yellow), but no errors (red)

## Success Criteria

### Phase 0 (Automated) ✅ PASSED
- [x] UI files re-embedded successfully
- [x] Build/embedded files are identical (verified by diff)
- [x] Go binaries built (Linux + Windows)
- [x] Server starts and loads embedded UI
- [x] Homepage HTML served correctly
- [x] API endpoints responding with valid JSON

### Phase 1 (Manual Browser Testing) ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] All 7 routes load without console errors
- [ ] Navigation highlighting works
- [ ] Theme toggle persists across reloads
- [ ] No `e.subscribe is not a function` error (Navigation fix verified)
- [ ] Console is clean (zero red errors)

---

## Navigation Fix Verification

**File:** `ui/src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte`
**Lines:** 68-76

**Fix Applied:** ✅ Reactive `$page` store (NOT manual `.subscribe()`)

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT (reactive statement with null safety):
$: {
  if ($page?.url?.pathname) {
    if (currentPath && currentPath !== $page.url.pathname) {
      logger.navigate(currentPath, $page.url.pathname);
    }
    currentPath = $page.url.pathname;
  }
}
```

This fix is now embedded in the Go binary and should prevent the `e.subscribe is not a function` error.

## Next Steps

### If Manual Browser Test PASSES:
1. ✅ Mark Phase 1 as complete in GETTING_UNSTUCK.md
2. Document results in this file
3. Update LLM-Update.md with smoke test results
4. Proceed to Phase 2: Screen-by-screen implementation
5. Start with Scanner screen (Week 1-2 of roadmap)

### If Manual Browser Test FAILS:
1. Document exact error messages and console output
2. Note which step failed
3. Screenshot of error (if possible)
4. Review FRONTEND_BUG_SUMMARY.md for troubleshooting
5. Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox/Edge recommended)

## Windows Testing

**Status:** Binaries built but not yet tested on Windows

**To test on Windows:**
1. Copy `backend/tf-engine.exe` to Windows machine
2. Open PowerShell in same directory as tf-engine.exe
3. Run: `.\tf-engine.exe init` (first time only)
4. Run: `.\tf-engine.exe server --listen 127.0.0.1:18888`
5. Open browser to http://localhost:18888
6. Follow Phase 1 manual test checklist above

**Expected:** Same results as Linux testing (all routes work, no errors)
