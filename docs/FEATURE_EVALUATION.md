## Potential Issues to Monitor

### Known Limitations (By Design)
1. **FINVIZ Scanner Dependency** - External site may be slow or unavailable
   - **Mitigation:** Clear error messages, timeout handling
   - **Not fixable:** External dependency

2. **2-Minute Cool-Off Timer** - Intentional friction
   - **Mitigation:** None - this is a feature, not a bug
   - **Expected user feedback:** Impatience (working as intended)

### Areas Requiring Monitoring

#### 1. Breadcrumb Navigation
- **Risk:** May add visual clutter on mobile
- **Monitor:** User feedback, mobile usage patterns
- **Action if problematic:** Add hide/show toggle or auto-collapse on mobile

#### 2. Debug Panel (Dev Mode)
- **Risk:** Accidental toggle by users in production
- **Monitor:** Ensure dev-only flag is respected
- **Action if exposed:** Add authentication or remove from production builds

#### 3. Notification System
- **Risk:** Too many notifications = notification fatigue
- **Monitor:** Frequency of notifications per session
- **Action if excessive:** Reduce notification frequency, add preferences

#### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Risk:** Conflicts with browser/OS shortcuts
- **Monitor:** User reports of unexpected behavior
- **Action if conflicts:** Make shortcuts customizable

- **Interactions:** Button clicks, form submissions
- **Errors:** Frontend errors with stack traces
- **Performance:** API call durations, page load times
- **User Actions:** Trade decisions, scanner runs, evaluations

Logs are:
- Stored in browser (last 1000 entries)
- Exportable via Debug Panel
- Color-coded by severity
- Timestamped to millisecond precision

---

A feature should be considered for removal if:
1. **Usage <1% of sessions** for 2 consecutive months
2. **Error rate >10%** for 2 consecutive weeks
3. **User complaints >5 per week** for 2 consecutive weeks
4. **Performance consistently >2x target** despite optimization efforts
