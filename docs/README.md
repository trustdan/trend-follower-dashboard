## ü§ù Contributing

**Before Contributing:**
1. Read [WHY.md](project/WHY.md) - Understand the purpose
2. Read [DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md](dev/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md) - Understand the approach
3. Check anti-patterns - Know what to reject

**Development Workflow:**
1. Write Gherkin scenario first (see [BDD_GUIDE.md](dev/BDD_GUIDE.md))
2. Get agreement on behavior
3. Implement code
4. Write tests matching Gherkin
5. Document in milestone report

**Questions to Ask:**
- Does this support discipline or undermine it?
- Would Ed Seykota approve?
- Does it make impulsivity easier or harder?
- Is this solving a real problem or adding complexity?

**If unsure:** Read [WHY.md](project/WHY.md) again. The answer is there.

## üìû Support

**Documentation Issues:**
- Found a broken link? Fix it and note in commit message
- Found unclear documentation? Propose improvement
- Found missing documentation? Check if it belongs in a different folder

**Technical Issues:**
- Check milestone reports for known issues
- Check `tf-engine.log` and `TradingSystem_Debug.log` for correlation IDs
- Reference [PLAN.md](project/PLAN.md) for architecture questions

**Remember:** This is a discipline enforcement system. Documentation serves that mission by being clear, accurate, and focused.

Code serves discipline. Discipline does not serve code.
