  - Icon library: Lucide Icons or Heroicons
  - Updated success criteria: Day/night mode and gradients are **must-haves**
  - Strengthened Svelte justification (visual appeal, theme support, polish)

### What Changed (10:45 update)
- **Created Overview Plan** - 18,000+ word strategic foundation document
  - Location: `plans/overview-plan.md`
  - Defines the forest-over-trees perspective for the entire project
  - Respects anti-impulsivity.md philosophy throughout
  - Complete user workflow: FINVIZ scan → TradingView analysis → checklist → gates

  - Go backend + Svelte frontend architecture
  - Integration with existing tf-engine backend (all domain logic complete)
  - TradingView integration using Ed-Seykota.pine script
  - 5-phase implementation strategy (12 weeks estimated)
  - Proof-of-concept approach: Start with Fyne POC, then Svelte POC, choose best

### What Changed (10:25 update)
- **Updated README.md** - Added references to new documentation files

  - Listed PROGRESS.md as narrative progress document

### What Changed (10:20)
- **Created CLAUDE.md** - Comprehensive guidance document for future Claude Code instances
  - Documents the anti-impulsivity trading system philosophy
  - Details the 5 hard gates that cannot be bypassed
  - Provides backend API reference and development commands
  - Includes critical development rules (discipline over flexibility)
  - Contains GUI implementation guidance with Fyne recommendation
  - ~3,500 lines of project context and patterns

- **Established Documentation Framework**
  - Created `docs/LLM-update.md` for session-by-session tracking
  - Created `docs/PROGRESS.md` (this file) for narrative status
  - Acknowledged and will follow `1._RULES.md` operating rules
  - No Git in Linux; treat as scratch workspace

### Why
- Future Claude Code instances need comprehensive context about:
  - The unique anti-impulsivity design philosophy
  - The proven backend architecture and business logic
  - Development patterns and anti-patterns to avoid
  - How to build the GUI frontend

- Documentation must be **always current** per RULES.md to enable:
  - Seamless handoff between LLM sessions
  - Copy/paste into ChatGPT if needed
  - Manual Windows testing with clear instructions

### What's Next
1. Review the backend codebase structure in detail
2. Evaluate GUI framework options (Fyne, Gio, Wails)
3. Create a concrete GUI implementation plan
4. Build "Hello World" proof-of-concept GUI
5. Integrate first screen (Dashboard) with backend

## Technical Architecture

### Current (Backend Only)
```
Backend (Go) - tf-engine CLI
├─ cmd/tf-engine/        CLI entry point
└─ internal/
   ├─ domain/            Core business logic ⭐
   ├─ storage/           SQLite persistence ⭐
   ├─ scrape/            FINVIZ web scraping
   ├─ cli/               Command handlers
   ├─ server/            HTTP server (legacy)
   └─ logx/              Logging utilities
```

### Target (Backend + GUI)
```
Custom GUI (Go + Fyne/Gio)
├─ Direct in-process function calls
└─ No HTTP, no CLI spawning
   ↓
Backend (Go) - tf-engine
├─ All existing functionality
└─ Single binary deployment
```

## Design Principles (Critical)

### The 5 Hard Gates (Cannot Be Bypassed)
1. **Signal** - 55-bar breakout (long > 55-high / short < 55-low)
2. **Risk/Size** - Per-unit risk using 2×N stop; pyramids every 0.5×N
3. **Options** - 60–90 DTE, roll/close ~21 DTE, liquidity required
4. **Exits** - 10-bar opposite Donchian OR closer of 2×N
5. **Behavior** - 2-minute cool-off + no intraday overrides

**Banner States:**
- RED: Any required gate fails → DO NOT TRADE
- YELLOW: All required pass, quality score < threshold → CAUTION
- GREEN: All required pass, quality score ≥ threshold → OK TO TRADE

### Anti-Impulsivity Core
- **Trade the tide, not the splash** - Donchian breakouts only
- **Friction where it matters** - Hard gates for discipline
- **Nudge for better trades** - Quality score affects banner, not permission
- **Immediate feedback** - Large 3-state banner updates live
- **No backdoors** - Cannot bypass gates, skip cooldowns, or override caps

---

## Development Constraints (from RULES.md)

### Golden Rules
1. ✅ Always read RULES.md first (acknowledged)
2. ✅ Never create or initialize Git in Linux (workspace is ephemeral)
3. ✅ Continuously update documentation (LLM-update.md, PROGRESS.md, README.md)
4. Windows-first deliverables (will cross-compile .exe)
5. No background tasks (all work in active session)

### Build Strategy
- Develop on Linux (WSL2/Kali)
- Cross-compile Go backend to Windows .exe
- GUI framework must support cross-platform builds
- Manual handoff: zip → Windows Git repo → test → commit

---

- CLI commands work correctly
- Database operations reliable
- Cross-compilation successful

### Frontend (🎯 Target)
- Single binary deployment
- < 100ms calculation response
- Large, obvious 3-state banner
- Cannot bypass gates
- 2-minute cooloff enforced
- Heat caps strictly enforced

### Overall (🎯 Target)
- User can download, run, complete trade workflow in < 10 minutes
- Zero ways to impulsively trade
- Clear visual feedback at every step
- Professional, production-ready application

---

## Notes and Decisions

### Why Fresh Start?
Excel/VBA frontend had fundamental issues (see PROJECT_HISTORY.md):
- Parse function signature mismatches
- Type name and property errors
- OLE control compatibility problems
- Difficult testing and deployment
- Poor developer experience

**Solution:** Custom GUI with direct Go backend calls (no HTTP/CLI overhead)

### Why Go + Fyne/Gio?
- Backend already in Go (proven, tested)
- Single language for full stack
- Cross-platform native GUI
- Single binary deployment
- No runtime dependencies

### Why Not Web UI?
- Native GUI is faster
- More responsive
- Easier deployment (single binary)
- Better user experience for desktop app

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Backend functionality (100% complete, fully tested)
- Position sizing algorithms (Van Tharp method, proven)
- Heat management (straightforward math)
- Database layer (SQLite, reliable)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- GUI framework choice (need proof-of-concept)
- Cross-platform UI consistency
- Large banner implementation (must be obvious)
- Windows packaging workflow

### Mitigated ✅
- Business logic complexity → Backend done
- Testing strategy → Comprehensive test suite exists
- Documentation gaps → Now complete

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Aggressive:** 8 weeks (2 months)
**Conservative:** 12 weeks (3 months)
**Current Progress:** Week 0 (planning and setup)

---

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29 10:20
**Status:** Backend ✅ Complete, Frontend 🚧 Not Started, Docs ✅ Complete
