# Getting Unstuck - Action Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-29 22:30
**Status:** ACTIONABLE PLAN READY

---

## Executive Summary

**The Wisdom from unstuck.md:** We had a **docs-heavy / code-light mismatch** where documentation read like completion but code reality hadn't caught up. The README claimed contradictory statuses ("Production Ready" vs "To be built"), creating confusion for both humans and AI assistants.

**Current Reality (Verified):**
- ‚úÖ UI code EXISTS (29 Svelte components, 7 route pages)
- ‚úÖ Navigation fix APPLIED (reactive `$page` store, not manual subscribe)
- ‚úÖ Build process WORKS (just tested, completes in 9.77s)
- ‚ùå Embedded files are STALE (build/ differs from backend/internal/webui/dist/)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation was contradictory (NOW FIXED)

**Path Forward:** We're on **Path A** (patch and ship existing UI), NOT Path B (bootstrap from scratch).

---

## What Was Wrong (Analysis)

### 1. Documentation Contradictions Found

**README.md had conflicting claims:**
- Line 8: "Frontend: ‚úÖ Embedded UI (Svelte) - Production Ready"
- Line 602: "Frontend: üöß To be built"

**Result:** Claude and humans both concluded "we're done" from the first claim, while the second claim was the truth.

### 2. Embedded UI Files Are Stale

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ diff ui/build/index.html backend/internal/webui/dist/index.html
Files differ
```

The Navigation.svelte fix exists in source code but hasn't been re-embedded into the Go binary.

### 3. Status Drift in LLM-Update.md

The log mixes planning activities ("planning documents only; no code changes") with implementation claims ("Svelte fix applied to Navigation.svelte"), making it hard to distinguish plan from reality.

---

## What We Actually Have (Ground Truth)

### Verified UI Components (29 files)

**Core Layout:**
- ‚úÖ `Header.svelte` - with theme toggle
- ‚úÖ `Navigation.svelte` - FIXED (reactive $page, no subscribe error)
- ‚úÖ `+layout.svelte` - app shell

**Route Pages (7):**
- ‚úÖ `+page.svelte` (Dashboard) - PARTIAL implementation with API calls
- ‚úÖ `scanner/+page.svelte` - placeholder
- ‚úÖ `checklist/+page.svelte` - placeholder
- ‚úÖ `sizing/+page.svelte` - placeholder
- ‚úÖ `heat/+page.svelte` - placeholder
- ‚úÖ `entry/+page.svelte` - placeholder
- ‚úÖ `calendar/+page.svelte` - placeholder

**UI Components (21+):**
- Banner, Card, Badge, Button, Input, Checkbox, Modal, Tooltip
- HeatBar, GateStatus, CoolOffTimer, DebugPanel
- WorkflowProgress, Breadcrumbs, Notification
- LoadingSpinner, Skeleton
- PositionTable, TradingViewLink
- And more...

**What Works:**
- Theme toggle (localStorage persistence)
- Navigation highlighting (active route detection)
- API client structure
- Logger utility
- Build process (Vite + SvelteKit + adapter-static)

**What Doesn't:**
- Embedded files are from Oct 29 22:01 (stale)
- Most route pages are placeholders (not fully implemented)
- Dashboard has API structure but needs completion
- No end-to-end testing done yet

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Priority Order)

### Phase 0: Sync Build Artifacts (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Get the fixed Navigation.svelte into the embedded UI

```bash
# 1. Clean old embedded files
cd /home/kali/trend-follower-dashboard
rm -rf backend/internal/webui/dist/*

# 2. Copy fresh build
rsync -av --delete ui/build/ backend/internal/webui/dist/

# 3. Verify sync
diff ui/build/index.html backend/internal/webui/dist/index.html
# Should output: (no differences)

# 4. Rebuild Go binary
cd backend
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o tf-engine cmd/tf-engine/main.go

# 5. Test server
./tf-engine server --listen 127.0.0.1:18888
# Open http://localhost:18888 and test navigation
```

**Success Criteria:**
- No `e.subscribe is not a function` errors
- All nav links work
- Theme toggle persists
- Console is clean (F12)

### Phase 1: Definition of Done for UI Shell (1-2 hours)

Using unstuck.md's "Definition of Done" checklist:

- [x] Header with theme toggle that persists (localStorage) - EXISTS
- [x] Sidebar navigation that highlights active route via `$page.url.pathname` - EXISTS
- [x] Navigation never throws `e.subscribe` errors - FIXED in code, needs re-embed
- [x] Navigation logs navigation events - EXISTS
- [x] Placeholder pages for all 7 screens - EXISTS
- [ ] Go backend embeds UI and serves at `/` - NEEDS TESTING
- [ ] 5-minute smoke test passes (see below)

**5-Minute Smoke Test:**
1. Build UI: `cd ui && npm run build`
2. Embed UI: `rsync -av --delete build/ ../backend/internal/webui/dist/`
3. Build backend: `cd ../backend && go build -o tf-engine cmd/tf-engine/main.go`
4. Start server: `./tf-engine server`
5. Open browser: `http://localhost:18888`
6. Open DevTools: Press F12
7. Test each nav item: Dashboard, Scanner, Checklist, Sizing, Heat, Entry, Calendar
8. Check console: **Zero red errors**
9. Toggle theme: Should animate smoothly and persist on reload
10. Check localStorage: Should see theme preference

**Pass/Fail:** If any step fails, we're not "shell done" yet.

### Phase 2: Screen-by-Screen Implementation (4-8 weeks)

**Priority order (from roadmap):**

1. **Scanner** (Week 1-2)
   - FINVIZ import UI
   - Candidate table
   - Preset filters
   - Manual refresh

2. **Checklist** (Week 2-3)
   - 5 required gates checkboxes
   - Optional quality items
   - Banner calculation (RED/YELLOW/GREEN)
   - 2-minute cooloff timer

3. **Position Sizing** (Week 3-4)
   - ATR-based calculation form
   - Stock/Options method selector
   - Results display
   - Pyramid table

4. **Heat Check** (Week 4-5)
   - Portfolio heat display
   - Bucket heat breakdown
   - Visual heat meter
   - Cap warnings

5. **Trade Entry** (Week 5-6)
   - 5 gates final check
   - GO/NO-GO decision
   - Save to database
   - Journal integration

6. **Calendar** (Week 6-7)
   - 10-week √ó sector grid
   - Position distribution view
   - Sector cooldowns
   - Visual diversification check

7. **Dashboard** (Week 7-8)
   - Complete implementation
   - Position table
   - Recent decisions
   - Quick stats

## Documentation Cleanup Actions

### Fix LLM-Update.md (Add Reality Check Entry)

Add this entry to `docs/LLM-Update.md`:

```markdown
## [2025-10-29 22:30] Reality Check - Getting Unstuck

**Summary:** Documentation audit revealed status mismatch; corrected README contradictions

**Ground Truth Verified:**
- UI code EXISTS: 29 Svelte components, 7 route pages
- Navigation fix APPLIED: reactive `$page` store (lines 68-76 in Navigation.svelte)
- Build process WORKS: Vite builds successfully in 9.77s
- Embedded files STALE: ui/build/ differs from backend/internal/webui/dist/
- README FIXED: Removed "Production Ready" contradiction

**Files touched:**
- `README.md`: Updated status from contradictory "Production Ready" + "To be built" to accurate "Shell Complete - Core Screens WIP"
- `docs/GETTING_UNSTUCK.md`: Created comprehensive action plan (this document)
- `docs/UNSTUCK.md`: Copied from /home/kali/unstuck.md (external analysis)

**Commands run (copy-paste ready):**
```bash
# Verify UI build
cd /home/kali/trend-follower-dashboard/ui && npm run build

# Check embedded files
ls -la /home/kali/trend-follower-dashboard/backend/internal/webui/dist/

# Compare build to embedded
diff ui/build/index.html backend/internal/webui/dist/index.html
# Result: Files differ (embedded is stale)
```

**Build artifacts (Linux):**
- `ui/build/*` - Fresh Svelte build (Oct 29 22:28)
- `backend/internal/webui/dist/*` - Stale embedded files (Oct 29 22:01)

**Windows Notes (for manual testing):**
- Need to re-embed UI and rebuild Windows binary
- Test Navigation fix in browser (no `e.subscribe` errors)
- Run 5-minute smoke test per GETTING_UNSTUCK.md

**Open Questions / Blockers:**
- None - path forward is clear (re-embed UI, test, implement features)

**Next Actions:**
1. Re-embed UI files (rsync build/ ‚Üí webui/dist/)
2. Rebuild Go binary (both Linux and Windows)
3. Run 5-minute smoke test
4. Begin screen-by-screen implementation (Scanner first)
```

### Keep Testing Guides Updated

The following docs are GOOD and should be preserved:
- `TESTING_GUIDE_WINDOWS.md` - Comprehensive Windows testing checklist
- `docs/FRONTEND_BUG_SUMMARY.md` - Excellent root cause analysis

**Label them clearly:**
- Add header: "**Pre-requisite:** UI shell must pass 5-minute smoke test first"
- Reference GETTING_UNSTUCK.md for the smoke test procedure

---

## Key Lessons from unstuck.md

### 1. Plans ‚â† Reality
**Problem:** Planning documents read like completion reports.
**Solution:** Clearly label planning docs with "PLAN" or "ROADMAP" and never claim "done" until verified.

### 2. Documentation Must Match Code
**Problem:** README claimed both "Production Ready" and "To be built."
**Solution:** Single source of truth for status. Use detailed breakdown (shell ‚úÖ, features üöß).

### 3. Falsifiable "Done" Criteria
**Problem:** No clear test for "is the UI done?"
**Solution:** 5-minute smoke test is the gate. No exceptions.

### 4. Code Beats Docs
**Problem:** Extensive docs but stale build artifacts.
**Solution:** "Show me the working binary" is the only real metric.

## Communication Guidelines

**When reporting status:**
- ‚úÖ Use: "Shell complete, Scanner 40% implemented"
- ‚ùå Avoid: "Frontend production ready"

**When documenting progress:**
- ‚úÖ Use: "Code changes: Navigation.svelte lines 68-76"
- ‚ùå Avoid: "Fixed navigation (planning only)"

**When updating README:**
- ‚úÖ Use: Granular checklist (Header ‚úÖ, Nav ‚úÖ, Dashboard üöß)
- ‚ùå Avoid: Binary "done" claims without verification

---

## Appendix: Quick Commands Reference

### Build Pipeline (Correct Order)
```bash
# 1. Build UI
cd /home/kali/trend-follower-dashboard/ui
npm run build

# 2. Clean old embedded files
rm -rf ../backend/internal/webui/dist/*

# 3. Copy fresh build
rsync -av --delete build/ ../backend/internal/webui/dist/

# 4. Rebuild backend (Linux)
cd ../backend
go build -o tf-engine cmd/tf-engine/main.go

# 5. Rebuild backend (Windows from Linux)
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o tf-engine.exe cmd/tf-engine/main.go

# 6. Test locally
./tf-engine server --listen 127.0.0.1:18888
# Open http://localhost:18888
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check UI build freshness
ls -la ui/build/index.html

# Check embedded files freshness
ls -la backend/internal/webui/dist/index.html

# Verify sync (should be identical)
diff ui/build/index.html backend/internal/webui/dist/index.html

# Count Svelte components
find ui/src -name "*.svelte" -type f | wc -l

# Check for Navigation bug pattern (should be zero)
grep -r "page\.subscribe" ui/src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte || echo "Not found (good!)"

# Check for correct reactive pattern (should find it)
grep -r "\$page" ui/src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte
```

## Final Thought

**unstuck.md was right:** We had excellent planning but status drift. The fix isn't to throw away the work‚Äîit's to:
1. ‚úÖ Align documentation with reality (DONE)
2. Re-embed the fixed UI (5 minutes)
3. Prove the shell works (5-minute smoke test)
4. Build features methodically (4-8 weeks, screen by screen)

**We're not starting over. We're shipping what we built.**

The shell is 95% ready. Let's close that last 5% and move to features.

---

**Ready to execute?** Start with Phase 0 (re-embed UI) and report results.
