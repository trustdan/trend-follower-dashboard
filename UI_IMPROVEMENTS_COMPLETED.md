### ✅ Phase 1: Critical UX

#### 1. Theme System with British Racing Green
**Files Modified:** `ui/theme.go`

- Implemented complete custom theme with British Racing Green (#004225) color palette

  - **Dark Mode:** Dark charcoal background (#1E1E1E), dark cards (#282828)
- Banner colors for discipline enforcement:
  - GREEN (#2E7D32) - GO, all gates passed
  - YELLOW (#FFC107) - CAUTION, missing optional items
  - RED (#D32F2F) - NO-GO, required gates failed

#### 2. Dark/Light Mode Toggle
**Files Modified:** `ui/main.go`

2. **TF-Momentum-Uptrend** - Large caps in uptrend, 1-year gainers
3. **TF-Unusual-Volume** - Unusual volume, above 200/50 SMA
4. **TF-Breakdown-Short** - New lows, large caps, below 200/50 SMA
5. **TF-Momentum-Downtrend** - Large caps in downtrend, 1-year losers

Layout: Two rows of preset buttons (3 in first row, 2 in second row)

#### 4. Functional Edit Settings Dialog

  - Purpose: prevent concentration risk
  - How it works: mechanical enforcement
- Clear emphasis: "This is discipline enforcement, not flexibility"

### ✅ Phase 2: User Guidance

**Files Modified:** `ui/checklist.go`

Added info icon buttons (ℹ️) next to each checklist item:

- **Regime OK:** Explains market regime filter (e.g., SPY > 200SMA)
- **No Chase:** Explains entry discipline (not > 2N above 20-EMA)

Each tooltip uses `dialog.ShowInformation()` with clear, concise explanations.

#### 7. Position Sizing Method Explanations
