# How to Run Initial Setup

## Problem: "Dropdown Error - Run Setup.RunInitialSetup"

If you see this error message:
```
Some dropdowns could not be created:
Preset dropdown: Application-defined or object-defined error

This usually means the data tables haven't been created yet.
Run Setup.RunInitialSetup first.
```

## Solution: Click the Button!

### Easy Way (Recommended):

1. **Go to the Setup sheet**
2. **Look for the big button at the top:** `â–¶ RUN INITIAL SETUP`
3. **Click it**
4. **Wait for completion** (5-10 seconds)
5. **Done!**

The button will:
- Create all data sheets (Presets, Buckets, Candidates, Decisions, Positions, etc.)
- Create all data tables (tblPresets, tblBuckets, etc.)
- Seed default data (5 presets, 6 buckets)
- Build the TradeEntry UI
- Set up all dropdowns

---

## Alternative: Run from VBA Editor

If the button doesn't work, you can run it manually:

### Step 1: Open VBA Editor
- Press **Alt + F11** (or Alt + Fn + F11 on some keyboards)
- Or: Developer tab â†’ Visual Basic

### Step 2: Open Immediate Window
- Press **Ctrl + G**
- Or: View â†’ Immediate Window
- You'll see a window at the bottom labeled "Immediate"

### Step 3: Type and Run Command
In the Immediate Window, type:
```vba
Setup.RunInitialSetup
```

Then press **Enter**

### Step 4: Wait for Completion
- You'll see a progress message
- Wait 5-10 seconds
- A "Setup Complete!" message will appear

### Step 5: Close VBA Editor
- Press **Alt + Q**
- Or: File â†’ Close and Return to Microsoft Excel

## What Initial Setup Does

When you run Setup.RunInitialSetup, it:

### 1. Creates Sheets
- âœ… TradeEntry (main UI)
- âœ… Presets (FINVIZ queries)
- âœ… Buckets (sector groupings)
- âœ… Candidates (daily stock lists)
- âœ… Decisions (trade log)
- âœ… Positions (current positions)
- âœ… Summary (settings)
- âœ… Control (hidden - internal use)
- âœ… Setup (instructions)

### 2. Creates Tables
- âœ… tblPresets - 5 default FINVIZ presets
- âœ… tblBuckets - 6 sector buckets
- âœ… tblCandidates - Empty (you import tickers here)
- âœ… tblDecisions - Empty (trade history)
- âœ… tblPositions - Empty (open positions)

### 3. Sets Up UI
- âœ… Builds TradeEntry sheet layout
- âœ… Creates buttons (Evaluate, Recalc, Save, etc.)
- âœ… Creates checkboxes (6 checklist items)
- âœ… Binds dropdowns to tables

### 4. Defines Settings
- âœ… Equity_E = $10,000 (account size)
- âœ… RiskPct_r = 0.75% (risk per trade)
- âœ… HeatCap_H_pct = 4% (max portfolio heat)
- âœ… And more...

## After Running Setup

You should see:
1. **All sheets exist** (check the sheet tabs at bottom)
2. **TradeEntry sheet has UI** (labels, buttons, input fields)
3. **Dropdowns work:**
   - B5 (Preset) â†’ 5 options
   - B7 (Sector) â†’ 6 options
   - B8 (Bucket) â†’ 6 options
4. **No error messages**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Button doesn't exist"
**Solution:** The Setup sheet wasn't created properly.
1. Press Alt+F11 to open VBA
2. Press Ctrl+G for Immediate window
3. Type: `Setup.RunInitialSetup`
4. Press Enter

### "Run-time error"
**Solution:** Setup already ran or sheets already exist.
- This is usually OK
- Check if TradeEntry sheet exists
- Check if dropdowns work
- If still broken, try: `Setup.RunInitialSetup` again (it will overwrite)

### "Compile error"
**Solution:** VBA modules not imported correctly.
- Close Excel
- Run BUILD.bat again
- Make sure all modules import successfully

### "Nothing happens"
**Solution:** Check the debug log.
1. Click "Open Debug Log" button
2. Look for errors
3. Search for "RunInitialSetup"
4. Check what went wrong

## When to Run Setup Again

You might need to re-run setup if:
- ðŸ”„ Dropdowns stop working
- ðŸ”„ Tables get deleted accidentally
- ðŸ”„ Sheets get corrupted
- ðŸ”„ You want to reset to defaults
- ðŸ”„ Error messages about missing tables

**Running setup again is safe** - it will:
- âœ… Overwrite existing sheets/tables
- âœ… Preserve your existing data (if any)
- âœ… Re-seed default presets and buckets
- âœ… Rebuild the UI
