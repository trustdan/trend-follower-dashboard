# Checklist UX Improvements

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Built

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Next Button Now Works

**Before:**
- "Next: Position Sizing →" button just showed a dialog
- User had to manually click navigation menu

**After:**
- Button actually navigates to Position Sizing tab
- Smooth workflow progression from Checklist → Position Sizing

**Implementation:**
- Added `navigateToTab` callback to AppState
- Next button calls `state.navigateToTab(3)` to switch tabs
- Only appears when banner is GREEN (all required gates passed)

### 2. ✅ Plain-English Help Text with Examples

**Before:**
- Technical jargon: "Donchian breakout filter", "2×N stop distance", "bid-ask < 10%"
- Short descriptions without context
- No examples to illustrate concepts

**After:**
- Beginner-friendly explanations for ALL 8 gates (5 required + 3 optional)
- Real-world examples with actual numbers
- "Think of it like" analogies to make concepts relatable
- Clear ✓ GOOD / ✗ BAD indicators

## New Help Text Format

Each gate explanation now includes:

1. **What it means** - Plain English definition
2. **Why it matters** - Why this gate exists
3. **Example** - Concrete example with numbers
4. **Think of it like** - Real-world analogy
5. **Not Required But** (optional items only) - Impact on quality score

## Updated Gates

### Required Gates (Must All Pass)

#### 1. From Preset (SIG_REQ)
```
What it means:
The stock came from today's FINVIZ screener results, not from a random idea or tip.

Example:
✓ GOOD: AAPL showed up in your FINVIZ scan for "new 55-day highs"
✗ BAD: Your friend texted you about AAPL looking good

Think of it like:
Only dating people who meet your criteria, not random people you bump into.
```

#### 2. Trend Confirmed (RISK_REQ)
```
What it means:
For longs: Stock price just broke above its highest point in 55 days
For shorts: Stock price just broke below its lowest point in 55 days

Example:
AAPL was trading between $150-$180 for 2 months, then broke above $180
✓ GOOD: Enter long when it breaks $180 (new 55-day high)
✗ BAD: Try to guess if $175 is "good enough" to enter

Think of it like:
Joining a race car that's already speeding up, not trying to time when it will start.
```

#### 3. Liquidity OK (OPT_REQ)
```
What it means:
If trading options: There's enough trading volume to get in and out easily.
If trading stocks: Average daily volume is high enough (usually 500K+ shares).

Example (Options):
Option shows: Bid $4.80, Ask $5.20, Open Interest 250 contracts
✓ GOOD: Spread is $0.40 (8% of $5.00) and 250 contracts available
✗ BAD: Spread is $0.80 (16%) or only 20 contracts available

Think of it like:
Trading at a busy market vs. trying to sell something on a deserted street.
```

#### 4. TV Confirm (EXIT_REQ)
```
What it means:
You've confirmed your exit plan BEFORE entering the trade.
You know exactly when you'll get out, whether you win or lose.

The Rule:
Exit when price breaks the 10-day low (for longs) OR hits your stop loss,
whichever happens first.

Example:
You bought AAPL at $180 with a stop at $177
✓ Exit if: Price hits $177 (stop loss) OR breaks below 10-day low
✗ Don't: "Let me see what happens" or "I'll decide later"

Think of it like:
Setting your GPS destination before driving, not figuring it out as you go.
```

#### 5. Earnings OK (BEHAV_REQ)
```
What it means:
1. You've waited at least 2 minutes since evaluating this trade
2. The stock doesn't have earnings coming up in the next 5 days
3. You're not changing your mind multiple times today

The 2-Minute Rule:
If you can't wait 2 minutes, you're probably being impulsive.
Good trades will still be good trades in 2 minutes.

Example:
✓ GOOD: Evaluated at 10:00am, waited until 10:02am to enter
✓ GOOD: Checked - no earnings until next month
✗ BAD: Immediately hitting buy after seeing the breakout
✗ BAD: Company reports earnings tomorrow morning

Think of it like:
Waiting 2 minutes before sending an angry email - often saves you from mistakes.
```

### Optional Quality Items (Improve Score)

#### 6. Regime OK
```
What it means:
The overall market is moving in your direction.
For longs: The S&P 500 (SPY) is above its 200-day average
For shorts: The S&P 500 is below its 200-day average

Example:
SPY at $450, 200-day average at $420
✓ GOOD for longs: Market is in uptrend (+7% above average)
✗ RISKY for longs: Market at $390 (below average) - fighting the tide

Think of it like:
Swimming downstream vs. upstream - both work, but one is easier.
```

#### 7. No Chase
```
What it means:
The stock hasn't run up too far, too fast from its recent average price.
Specifically: Entry price isn't more than 2× ATR above the 20-day average.

Example:
Stock's 20-day average: $100
ATR (daily volatility): $3
Current price: $104
✓ GOOD: Only $4 above average (< 2×$3 = $6 limit)
✗ RISKY: Price at $108 (too extended - likely near a pullback)

Think of it like:
Joining a party that just started vs. showing up at 2am when it's winding down.
```

#### 8. Journal Entry Written
```
What to Write:
"AAPL broke above 55-day high at $180. Entry at $181, stop at $177.
Target: hold for trend exit at 10-day low. Risk $300 for $900+ potential.
Could fail if market sells off or sector rotation happens."

Why it matters:
Writing forces you to think clearly. If you can't explain the trade
in writing, you probably don't understand it well enough to risk money.

Think of it like:
Planning a road trip vs. just getting in the car and driving randomly.
```

## User Experience Improvements

```

### Help Text Quality

**Before:**
> "Trend confirmed: Long > 55-high OR Short < 55-low. Uses 2×N stop distance.
> This is the Donchian breakout filter - the core signal."

**After:**
> What it means:
> For longs: Stock price just broke above its highest point in 55 days
>
> Why it matters:
> You're catching a strong momentum move. The trend is clearly established.
> You're not trying to predict a reversal or catch a falling knife.
>
> Example:
> AAPL was trading between $150-$180 for 2 months, then broke above $180
> ✓ GOOD: Enter long when it breaks $180 (new 55-day high)
> ✗ BAD: Try to guess if $175 is "good enough" to enter
>
> Think of it like:
> Joining a race car that's already speeding up, not trying to time when it will start.

## Testing

✅ Built successfully
✅ Next button navigates to Position Sizing (tab index 3)
✅ All help buttons show improved plain-English text
✅ Examples are clear and actionable
✅ Analogies make concepts relatable

## Usage

Run the updated GUI:
```powershell
.\tf-gui.exe
```

To test the improvements:
1. Start a new trade session
2. Go to Checklist tab
3. Click any ⓘ info button - see detailed plain-English explanations
4. Check all 5 required gates
5. Click "Evaluate Checklist"
6. Banner turns GREEN
7. Click "Next: Position Sizing →" button
8. **You're automatically taken to Position Sizing tab!**

## Philosophy Alignment

These changes align with the anti-impulsivity design:

✅ **Education over confusion** - Help text teaches principles, not just rules
✅ **Clarity over jargon** - Plain English makes gates understandable
✅ **Examples over theory** - Real numbers show what "good" looks like
✅ **Smooth workflow** - Auto-navigation reduces friction for correct behavior

The system is still strict (all 5 gates must pass), but now users understand **WHY**.

---

**Impact:** Better user education + Smoother workflow = Higher discipline compliance
**Status:** Ready for production use
**Built:** tf-gui.exe (50MB, includes all improvements)
